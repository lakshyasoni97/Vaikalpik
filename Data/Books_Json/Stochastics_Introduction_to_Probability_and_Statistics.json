Not only in the games of\nchance such as lottery or roulette where risk is played with, but also in substantialparts of everyday life. Every time an insurance company uses the claim frequenciesto calculate the future premium, or a fund manager the most recent stock charts torearrange his portfolio, every time cars are jamming at a traf\ufb01c node or data pack-ages at an internet router, every time an infection spreads out or a bacterium turnsinto a resistant mutant, every time pollutant concentrations are measured or politicaldecisions are based on opinion polls \u2013 in all such cases a considerable amount ofrandomness comes into play, and there is a need to analyse the random situation andto reach at rational conclusions in spite of the inherent uncertainty. Precisely this isthe objective of the \ufb01eld of stochastics, the \u2018mathematics of chance\u2019. Stochastics istherefore a highly applied science, which tries to solve concrete demands of manydisciplines. At the same time, it is genuine mathematics \u2013 with sound systematics,clear-cut concepts, deep theorems and sometimes surprising cross-connections. Thisinterplay between applicability on the one side and mathematical precision and ele-\ngance on the other makes up the speci\ufb01c appeal of stochastics, and a variety of natural\nquestions determines its lively and broad development.\nThis book offers an introduction to the typical way of thinking, as well as the basic\nmethods and results of stochastics. It grew out of a two-semester course which I gave\nrepeatedly at the University of Munich. It is addressed to students of mathematics inthe second year, and also to scientists and computer scientists who intend not only\nto apply stochastics, but also to understand its mathematical side. The two parts ofstochastics \u2013 probability theory and statistics \u2013 are presented in two separate parts ofthe book because of their own scopes and methods, but are united under the samecover on purpose. For, the statistics is built on the concepts and methods of proba-bility theory, whereas the latter needs the former as a bridge to reality. In the choice\nof the material I con\ufb01ned myself deliberately to the central subjects belonging to thestandard curriculum of the corresponding mathematical courses. (It is thus unavoid-\nable that some readers will miss their favourite subjects, e.g., the resampling methodsof statistics.) The standard themes, however, are discussed with all necessary details.Rather than starting with discrete models I preferred to present (and motivate) thegeneral measure theoretic framework right from the beginning, and some theoreticalissues are also treated later as the case arises. In general, however, the measure theo-\nretic apparatus is con\ufb01ned to what is absolutely necessary, and the emphasis is on the\ndevelopment of a stochastic intuition.\nGeorgii, Hans-Otto.

Severalpossibilities present themselves. For a \ufb01rst overview, the reader may concentrate onconcepts, theorems, and examples and skip all proofs. In particular, this is a prac-ticable route for non-mathematicians. A deeper understanding, of course, requiresthe study of a representative selection of proofs. On the other hand, a reader mainlyinterested in the theory and familiar with some applications may skip a portion of ex-amples. For a short route through Part I leading directly to statistics, one can restrictoneself to the essentials of the \ufb01rst chapters up to Section 3.4, as well as Sections 4.1and 4.3, and 5.1 and 5.2. The core of Part II consists of Sections 7.1 \u2013 7.5, 8.1 \u2013 8.2,9.2, Chapter 10, as well as 11.2 and 12.1. Depending on the speci\ufb01c interests, it willfacilitate orientation to browse through some portions of the text and return to themlater when needed. A list of notational conventions can be found on page 395.\nAt the end of each chapter there is a collection of problems offering applications,\nadditions, or supplements to the text. Their dif\ufb01culty varies, but is not indicated be-cause the reader should follow only his or her interests. The main point is to try foroneself. Nevertheless, this second English edition now provides draft solutions ofselected problems, marked with\nS. These should be used for self-testing, rather than\nlulling the reader\u2019s willingness to tackle the problems independently.\nAs every textbook, this one grew out of more sources than can possibly be identi-\n\ufb01ed. Much inspiration came from the classical German texts of Ulrich Krengel [38]and Klaus Krickeberg and Herbert Ziezold [39], which had strong in\ufb02uence on the in-troductory courses in stochastics all over Germany. I also got many impulses from myMunich stochastics colleagues Peter G\u00e4n\u00dfler and Helmut Pruscha as well as all thoseresponsible for the problem classes of my lectures during more than two decades:Peter Imkeller, Andreas Schief, Franz Strobl, Karin M\u00fcnch-Berndl, Klaus Ziegler,Bernhard Emmer, and Stefan Adams. I am very grateful to all of them.\nThe English translation of the German original would not have appeared without the\nassistance of two further colleagues: Marcel Ortgiese accepted to lay the foundationby preparing an initial English version, so that I could concentrate on details andcosmetic changes. Ellen Baake took pleasure in giving a \ufb01nal polish to the Englishand suggesting numerous clari\ufb01cations. I gratefully acknowledge their help.\nMunich, June 2012 Hans-Otto Georgii\nGeorgii, Hans-Otto. Stochastics : Introduction to Probability and Statistics, De Gruyter, Inc., 2012.
