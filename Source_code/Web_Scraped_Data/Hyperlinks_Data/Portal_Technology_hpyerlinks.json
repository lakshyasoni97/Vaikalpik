Project Alberta was formed in March 1945, and consisted of 51 United States Army, Navy, and civilian personnel, including one British scientist. Its mission was three-fold. It first had to design a bomb shape for delivery by air, then procure and assemble it. It supported the ballistic testing work at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, conducted by the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Project W-47), and the modification of B-29s to carry the bombs (Project Silverplate). After completion of its development and training missions, Project Alberta was attached to the 509th Composite Group at North Field, Tinian, where it prepared facilities, assembled and loaded the weapons, and participated in their use.

The route does not intersect with any state routes or county routes along its entire alignment. The portion from the Delaware River to Springers Lane, consisting of over half of the route, is marked with a \"Road Closed\" sign, with minimal if any maintenance \u2014 potholes and overgrowing vegetation plague this section. Route\u00a0324 was a former alignment of US\u00a0322 that served the Bridgeport-Chester ferry between Bridgeport, New Jersey, and Chester, Pennsylvania. The ferry first ran on July 1, 1930, with US\u00a0322 being designated along the ferry and its access road in 1936 from Pennsylvania. The highway and ferry also shared the co-designation of State Highway Route\u00a0S-44, a spur off State Highway Route\u00a044 in Bridgeport. Route\u00a0S-44 was decommissioned in the state highway renumbering while US\u00a0322 remained intact until the opening of the Commodore Barry Bridge in February 1974. The ferry made its last run at 8\u00a0p.m. on February 1, and closed down for good. US\u00a0322 was realigned onto the Commodore Barry Bridge while the former ferry alignment became Route\u00a0324.

The line branches off from the Nordland Line at Hell Station and runs eastwards to the Norway\u2013Sweden border, with Storlien Station acting as the border station. From there, the line continues as the Central Line. Traditionally, the Mer\u00e5ker Line was regarded as the whole line from Trondheim Central Station to the border, a distance of 102 kilometers (63\u00a0mi). There are two daily passenger train services operated by SJ Norge and a limited number of freight trains hauling lumber and wood chippings. Proposals for a railway were first made in 1870. Routes via Verdal and R\u00f8ros were soon discarded, and the Mer\u00e5ker Line was approved on 5 June 1873. The first revenue services ran in 1879, and the line was officially opened on 22 July 1882. The line boosted the local economy, allowing for same-day transport of produce to Trondheim. The line has been upgraded several times to increase the axle load. During World War II, the line was the scene of both the Hommelvik train collision and the Mer\u00e5ker train derailment. Steam trains were in use until 1971, following the introduction of diesel locomotives in 1961. From 1900 to 2005, Meraker Smelteverk was a significant customer, using the line to haul carbide, and later microsilica, from their mill at Kopper\u00e5 to the port at Muruvik. The Norwegian National Rail Administration plans to have the line electrified and have centralized traffic control installed by 2023.

Known for most of its length as Kearneysville Pike, the highway extends from WV 115 in Kearneysville north to the Maryland state line at the Potomac River in Shepherdstown, from where the highway continues as Maryland Route 34 (MD 34). The route is one of the main north\u2013south highways of northern Jefferson County and passes through the campus of Shepherd University. WV 480 was originally established in the early 1920s as West Virginia Route 48. The highway was paved in the mid-1920s, which included a different routing through Shepherdstown. WV 48's present routing through the town was established in the late 1930s when the first James Rumsey Bridge was completed; that bridge was replaced with the current bridge in the mid-2000s. WV 48 was renumbered to WV 480 in the mid-1970s after U.S. Route 48 (US 48) was established in West Virginia and Maryland.

For most of her career, she worked at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; starting as a computer at the segregated West Area Computing division, she later took advanced engineering classes and, in 1958, became NASA's first black female engineer. After 34\u00a0years at NASA, Jackson had earned the most senior engineering title available. Realizing that she could not earn further promotions without becoming a supervisor, she accepted a demotion to become a manager of the Federal Women's Program in the NASA Office of Equal Opportunity Programs, as well as of the Affirmative Action Program. In this role, she worked to influence both the hiring and promotion of women in NASA's science, engineering and mathematics careers. She was portrayed by Janelle Mon\u00e1e as a lead character in the 2016 film Hidden Figures. This picture, taken in 1980, shows Jackson working at NASA Langley.
